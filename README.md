## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Detail</summary>
  
>1. Motivation: In today’s world the traffic congestion problems are increasing exponentially.
Not only does this cause delays to the people driving it also delays the pedestrians and also
puts their safety at risk trying to navigate the busy intersections. It is imperative to have
a model that controls the traffic flow to ensure a safe and smooth transit for all the people,
which is why we have come up with TraCCS (Traffic Control and Coordination System).
>2. Problem Statement: The fixed-timing signals used today fail to adapt to fluctuating traffic
volumes throughout the day, leading to bottlenecks at busy intersections. In this project we
are going to implement a traffic light controller that controls crossroads consisting of a main
road (East-West) and an intersecting side road (North-South).
>3. Features:
>
>>• Adaptive Signal Control: Manually adjusting traffic light timings based on real-time
traffic conditions. This reduces wait times, prevents congestion, and optimizes traffic
flow.
>>
>>• Energy Efficiency: Integration of the the traffic light control system with clean, renew-
able solar energy to power the LED’s during daytime with a backup power source.
